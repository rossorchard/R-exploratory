## ORGANISATION

In my local computer, I have:

    a 'workspace' folder, in which each sub-folder correspond to a separate project
    a 'data' folder where I put all the data used by more than a project
    an 'archive' folder with all finished project




Within each project folder, I have:

    planning/ -> a folder containing all the files related to the early phase of the project. Usually this is the first folder I create, and here I store all the miscellaneous files (the notes/objectives/initial drafts) that I collect in the first weeks of a projects, when I still am not sure which programs to write.
    bugs/ -> I used to use ditz to keep track of bugs and To-Dos, but now I use only A7 hand-written papers
    data/
        folders containing the different data I need to use, soft-linked from ~/data
    parameters/ -> ideally, I should have configuration files so if I want to run my analysis on other dataset, I only have to change the parameters here
    src/ -> with all code
        a Makefile to re-run all the analysis I wish
        scripts/ with all the scripts
        lib/ eventually, if I am reusing code from other projects
        pipelines/ with all .mk (makefile) files
    results/
        tables/ -> tabular-like results
        plots/ -> plots
        manuscript/ -> draft for the manuscript, final figures and data, etc..
            figures/
            tables/
            references/
